# Welcome to the FurryGamesIndex project.

The motive for creating this project was that Lucky Doge gave up his [Furry Game Collection](https://doge.im/recommend/kemono-games.html) project, and Utopic Panther once benefited from the project of Lucky Doge, and trying to rebuild a game collection on the Internet. Lucky Doge [generously provided the results that he had made a lot of hard work](https://github.com/FurryGamesIndex/games/blob/master/luckydoge.txt), making it possible for this project to quickly develop into a practical list. The project pays more attention to maintainability, encourages community participation, provides convenient infrastructure for community participation and improves ease of use (such as tagging and search functions), and may also do voting and discussion in the future.

In this project, each game is structured in a independent YAML file. YAML is very easy to edit by furries and humans, and then it is automatically rendered into HTML versions in multiple languages by python scripts.
