name: Temptation's Ballad

description: |
  Temptation's Ballad is a fairly linear visual novel in a D&D; style medieval fantasy setting. Three idiots from vastly different backgrounds band together in an adventuring party to unravel the magical secrets within the city of Axia. Together, they battle demons, seduce locals, and learn a little about themselves along the way. And probably cause massive property damage.
  
  This visual novel is currently heavily work-in-progress. Patreon members will gain access to all monthly updates while the general public will gain access to builds every other month. 

  This game will contain NSFW lewd scenes between male characters. These scenes pop up occasionally throughout the story as characters grow more intimate. View at your own discretion. It's very gay.

  FAQ: How do I update my game after a new build releases?
  
  This varies depending on what platform you're on. If on Android, simply download the new build and install it. It should automatically update the version of the game you have installed. If on Windows/MAC/Linux, simply delete the old game folder and download the new build. Your saves are stored in your local files, so they should be retained after the update.
  
  Please note that the Android version is not stable on all Android devices. It is recommended that you play the PC, MAC, or Linux versions when possible.
