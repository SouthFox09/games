  Maybe you already know OVERTIME, my first comic project published some years ago.
  Working in something like that was an extremely challenging and fun experience that I was only able to repeat once with my other comic STRIP BRAWLERS but time and work schedules made it impossible for me to continue doing this kind of things until now.

  During the past year, your support helped me to create my third comic, OVERTIME 2 HARDWORKERS, my third comic that was completed during the past month and now it's time to finally see what comes next.

  This time I decided to try something a bit different so the next project that you'll be seeing here from now on will be a visual novel called STORIES FROM THE HOUSE OF BEEF.

  Since I never tried to do something like this before, and programming isn't one of my strongest skills, for this project I'll be having the help of Wolfstar,  (creator of Sins and Paradise), a good and talented friend that will be using his coding magic to bring this baby to life.

  And I also have to thank DyneWulf, creator of Extracurricular Activities for his help as well. And in case you haven't seen the great works they're doing here are their links so you visit their sites.
