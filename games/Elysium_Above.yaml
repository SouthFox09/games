  ##The Wanyan World
  
  On the Wanyan Land, Wanyan, a country of enfeoffment, though having enjoyed a long time peace, is facing the fate of division. Wanyan's authority is declining since 800 years ago, and every feudal state fought each other. The warfare is crushing countless states and killing endless people.

The newly born Seven State Alliance is at confrontation against Lu under Hong's leading, and has been integrating more states to join it. Between the two superpower there is the main stage of our story - Bo.
  
  Bo was destroyed in Lu's sudden attack 11 years ago, and Kui the king ended his life with fire in Wanyang Palace, while older prince Huang Zhu escaped to Hong in the south with third prince. Later Bo was all annexed by Lu. 11 years later, Huang Zhu took the chance when Lu garrison didn't aware, led an army to fight back. Again the threat of warfare and death is hanging over the coast of the East Sea. Besides, many powers are arriving here with each one's own desire. Maybe this war of restoration is simply the beginning of a series of chaos...
