  Far Beyond the World is a (+18) fantasy VN about a human lost in another world.

  "Wake up!" says the voice and you open your eyes in a strange cabin in the woods with only vague recollection of the life you've left behind. Despite appearances, you know that something isn't quite right. 
  
  Set on an adventure, trying to piece together the puzzle of your past, as well as forge a new life among the Wolves of Avalan as you try to steer clear of their tribal politics. Your heart will be your compass, but can you trust your feelings when they're so easily clouded? Love can be both a boon and a distraction. Choose your friends carefully and your enemies more careful still.

  You had one life already&hellip; there might not be a third.
