  《Disguise》is an adult gay furry visual novel set in modern age.

  The story starts with a middle-aged black panther, down to his seemingly successful life, and how he lives behind it all, away from the prying eyes.

  After his busy work settled down along with the sunset, a lingering need always starts growing within him during the lonely nights.

  Perhaps everyone is living under a disguise. This game brings to you every aspects of a certain man, but can you tell which part of him is the disguise?
