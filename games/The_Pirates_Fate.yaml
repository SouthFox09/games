  ##Story

  In The Pirate's Fate, you play as Mila, the newest member of the Dread Pirates. You’ll navigate stormy seas, seedy saloons, and monstrous coves in search of loot. And be warned: you aren’t the only pirates seeking this treasure!  

  ##Choices matter

  The choices you make alter Mila, the crew, and the story itself. Different plotlines and romances will become available depending on the paths you choose to take. Each plot path changes the relationship dynamics and the composition of your crew, as well as your place within it. Will you become a ruthless, cunning captain, or a diplomatic, peacemaking conciliator? 

  ##Your actions will transform the crew, literally

  The magical treasure that the Dread Pirates seek is a set of coins that can transform whoever holds them; to let them “become what they seek." They might change in age, appearance, gender, personality, and species—and even rewrite their own past!
