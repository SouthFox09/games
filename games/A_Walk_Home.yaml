  The download is >1GB, be aware of that!  
  You will need a somewhat decent gaming rig in order to play. Nothing too fancy, but just don't expect the game to run smoothly with onboard graphics or something like that.

  So, here we go. My first venture into the world of Video Games! Fun!  :3  
  I am really excited about this. I always wanted to make a Video Game. Since this is my first time doing something like this, don't expect all too much. It will be a tad buggy, a tad ugly, and a tad poorly optimized. But I made it and I'm proud of it :)  

  I'll plan on doing more Games, or at least interactive experiences, in the future, it was real fun! Let me know what you think!

  I also added a cheat menu! If you lost your save through a bug you still can continue where you left off! Or... you know, just skip a level that pisses you off or unlock all statues if you don't feel like doing it yourself. No shame in that!

  To Acess the cheat menu (spoiler warning!) - After you start up the game just type cum real fast on your keyboard as soon as the main title appears, but before the foxy starts walking in from the left.
