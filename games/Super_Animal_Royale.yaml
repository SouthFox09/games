  ##PLAY FOR FREE:

  Try the Super Free Edition and your progress will sync right into the full version when you upgrade.Fight for FURvival:
  
  Super Animal Royale is an intense, strategic, top-down 2D twist on the battle royale genre. Up to 64 adorably murderous animals fight tooth and claw (and machine gun) across diverse, exotic biomes, each vying for top dog (or top cat, or top sloth...you get the idea).
  
  Enjoy atmospheric battle royale action from a whole new top down perspective.
  
  An intuitive fog of war system enables sneaky, strategic play.
  
  Explore a massive, beautifully illustrated island paradise, with diverse biomes and the cryptic remains of a super safari park gone awry.
  
  Chop the tall grass to find hidden items, because thatâ€™s what you do with tall grass.So what makes the free edition super?Well, aside from the fact that sticking the word "Super" in front of everything makes it better, this isn't your typical demo/trial version. It allows you to play the game fully online, as much as you like! And you can even start progressing through the game, earning items and animal DNA. These cosmetic items you earn in the Super Free Edition are locked, so you won't be able to create new Super Animals or dress them up to make them your own, but if you like the game and choose to purchase it, all of your items and progress you've earned will transfer right into the full game! That's pretty Super, right? Hopefully not so super that you'll avoid supporting development of the game, but we're really proud of what we've built and the community that has grown around it, so we hope that giving you the chance to experience it for yourself will show you that it's an Early Access game worth supporting!
  
  Note: Free Edition players can play unlimited online multiplayer in any mode as much as they like and can invite both free and full edition friends using Discord invites! Steam friend invites are only available to players with the full game due to a technical limitation.Constantly evolving, refined gameplay:
  
  The top down view and streamlined mechanics make this the most accessible battle royale yet, while surprisingly deep strategy and a high skill cap rewards more advanced players. The game has also been optimized to run smoothly whether you play on a Macbook or a beastly gaming PC.
  
  The island and roster of genetically engineered super animals are constantly (ahem) evolving with updates. Your super animal can be customized with new outfits, tombstones, death explosions, weapons, dance moves, and more, so you can look your best as you do your worst.
