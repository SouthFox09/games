name: BROK the InvestiGator

description: |
  The first "Classic Adventure" mixed with Beat'em Up and RPG, inspired by cartoons from the 80's/early 90's. What kind of detective will you be?
  
  Narrative-driven adventure game that blends action and investigation in never-before-seen ways. Will you use your brain... or your brawn?
  
  In a futuristic "light cyberpunk" world where animals have replaced humans, privileged citizens live under a dome protected from the ambient pollution while others struggle to make a living outside.
  
  Brok, a private detective and former boxer, lives with Graff, the son of his deceased wife. Although he could never elucidate her accident, recent events may shed some light on an even more tragic outcome... one that may be linked to their own existence.
  
  Will they be able to withstand the threats of this corrupted world and face their own destiny?
